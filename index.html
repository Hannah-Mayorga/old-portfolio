    <h1><em>My Portfolio</em></h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Hannah Mayorga. I was born on March 18, 2001 and was born here in Indianapolis. I'm a 17 year old student at Warren Central High School. I work at Nextech and I work at Christian Park. <br>
       Both of my parents are from Nicaragua. I have two older sisters and the both of them are in their late 20s. My oldest sister, Georgina, is an educator at Southport. She's
       working right now to become a principal. My other sister, Melissa, works as management in hospital. They're both extremely successful and I strive to be as successful as them. </p>

    <h2>What I Like</h2>
    <p>Here's a quick list of a couple things that I like or am involved in.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Dogs (and cats!)</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li>Drawing/Painting</li>
        <li>Learning Japanese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>What I'm most interested in doing is becoming a programmer. I really love coding and all the creative freedom that comes with it. 
        So, I'm here at Nextech to learn as much as I can and challenge myself as much as possible to become a better programmer. In the future I'd like to own
        my own company at some point. Whether that be for games or something else. My main goal really is to create something that others can enjoy and geek out 
        over like I do. I like making people happy with the things I create, so as long as I can work hard to see others have fun with what I can make then I'll
        be happy too.  <br><br>
        If you wanna see more about me you can go to my <a href="https://github.com/Hannah-Mayorga"target="_blank"> GitHub profile </a> and hopefully I'll have better things than this pretty soon.
    </p>
